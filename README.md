# Car-Price-Prediction-RandomForestRegression
This project introduces a comprehensive Car Price Prediction system using Python, Pandas, and the Random Forest Regression algorithm. By compiling a dataset through web scraping, the system incorporates diverse car attributes. The data preprocessing phase ensures accuracy by handling missing values and eliminating irrelevant columns, resulting in a refined dataset. The Random Forest Regression model, chosen for its superior performance, is trained and optimized using a pipeline and grid search. The project also features a user-friendly web interface developed with Flask, HTML, and CSS, enabling real-time car price predictions based on user-input specifications. 
The system aims to provide valuable insights for prospective car buyers and sellers, combining the power of machine learning and web development to enhance the automotive market's user experience.
